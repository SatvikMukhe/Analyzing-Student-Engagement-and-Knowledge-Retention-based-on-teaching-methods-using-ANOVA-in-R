Title: Analyzing the Student Engagement and Knowledge Retention based on Engaging and Traditional Teaching method.

AIM : Our survey aims to identify the teaching method which is most preferable for the students and gives the best results and how students are engaged based on the teaching methods.

Methodology:

A survey method has been used for this study, where we conducted an in-person survey with students of BITS Pilani to collect  the data by circulating a google form with questionnaires.

The survey was conducted at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus where students from First Degree programs (B.E.), Higher Degree programs (MBA, M.E.) and Doctoral programs are selected randomly for collecting the responses for conducting the experiment

Independent Variables:

1)     Type of Teaching method (Traditional and Engaging): we have considered a topic called “Introduction to Neural Networks” where we included a 4-5 minutes video content on both traditional and engagement teaching styles and conducted the retention test and engagement on the teaching style

2)     Pre-requisite Knowledge on the domain (Yes or No): we also considered the pre requisite knowledge on the machine learning or neural network domain to check the student bias on the subject.

3)     Year of study (first year or senior): First-year students are typically transitioning from college to degree (which higher degree students from UG college/job to degree), experiencing new teaching styles and learning environments for the first time. In contrast, senior students have had a year to adapt and may respond differently to teaching styles based on their prior experiences.

Dependent Variables:

1)     Retention Test (on a scale of 7): we have set a total of 7 questions test for students related to the concepts demonstrated in neural network video for both teaching methods to understand how much the student retains the topic.

2)     Student Engagement (on a scale of 9): we also asked the students to provide their experience/feedback on watching the video on this topic by asking these questions:

a)      Did the teaching method used in the video capture your interest?

b)     Were your thoughts/focus fully on this video while watching?

c)      Did this video made you feel excited about the subject?

Control Variable:

1) Student of BITS Pilani, Pilani campus only.
